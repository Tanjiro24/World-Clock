World-Clock:

A World Clock is a web application that displays the current time for multiple cities around the world. Using HTML, you define the structure with placeholders for city names and times. With CSS, you style the layout to make the clock visually appealing and organized. JavaScript dynamically updates the time for each city in real-time by calculating time zone differences, providing users with an accurate and interactive global time-keeping tool.
